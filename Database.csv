This is Sirine Nsir, from Tunisia. I am 25-years-old. I am an Engineering Student at the High Institute of Computer Science and Mathematics of Monastir (ISMM), in Tunisia. I obtained my baccalaureate diploma in natural science in 2016 and a B.A. in Electronicand informatics in 2019. I have recently taken a decision to pursue my studies in the area of Electronic- Microelectronics engineering. My greatest strength is my ability to work well in a team environment. I really love working as part of a wider multi-cultural team. I am someone who sees into the big picture : I dream of initiating my own project/product from the scratch until it becomes something common not only in my country but in the entire world. I am an innovative and creative person. I have many projects ideas to do for this year and I am doing my best and trying to snatch every single opportunity to take part in renowned international challenges. I am interested in Embedded Systems and Web developement and I would like to become a certified expert in this area.;Smart Pharmacy Box;KeyWords <br /> #Pic 18F4550 <br /> #GSM 800 L <br /> #PIC C Compiler <br /> #LCD <br /> #Motion sensor <br /> #PCB Design <br />#ISIS ;Raspberry-Pi face Mask Detection;KeyWords <br /> #Tensorflow #Keras,<br /> #OpenCV <br /> #Python <br /> #RaspberryPi <br /> #Machine Learning <br /> #Real Time ;Arceau parking;KeyWords <br /> #ISIS <br /> #Android_app <br /> #Arduino <br /> #sensors <br /> #PCB Design <br /> #ISIS ;C/C++;85%;Python;90%;ISIS ;90% ;LABVIEW;50%;My skills ;TUNISIA : 2019-2022;Higher institute of Computer science and Mathematics of Monastir Monastir | Tunisia; Electronic & MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING ;TUNISIA : 2016-2019; Higher institute of Computer science and Mathematics of Monastir Monastir | Tunisia;Fundamental licence in Information , Communication Sciences and Technologies Electronics ;TUNISIA : 2012-2016;Abdel Aziz El Behi ;Bachelor's degree in Experimental Sciences ;My Academic timeline;
